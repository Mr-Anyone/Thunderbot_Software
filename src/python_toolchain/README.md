# Future Me

in case I forget, you would have to copy these two directories from your python folder to here to make it work.

1. include
2. libs

It should be in somewhere like the following: 
1. C://Users//Vince//AppData//Local//Programs//Python//Python311//include
2. C://Users//Vince//AppData//Local//Programs//Python//Python311//libs
